# data-staging-web-services
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating web services used for staging data for submission to NIMH Data Archives

[Jupyter Notebook](Web%20Data%20Staging%20Web%20Services%20June%202017.ipynb)

The notebook will describe available web services for programatically uploading and staging data that will subsequently be validated and submitted.

These services are being provided to support real-time transactions where the user wishes to upload data as it is received/processed. These transactions can be aggregated together, validated, and submitted at a later time or according to a schedule (i.e., weekly data submissions).
