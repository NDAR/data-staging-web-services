# data-staging-web-services
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating web services used for staging data for submission to NIMH Data Archives

The enclosed notebook will describe available web services for programatically uploading and staging data that will subsequently be validated and submitted.

These services are being provided to support real-time transactions where the user wishes to upload data as it is received/processed. These transactions can be aggregated together, validated, and submitted at a later time or according to a schedule (i.e., weekly data submissions).
